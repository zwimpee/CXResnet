# CXResnet
This project is an attempt to produce an image classification model that can distinguish between chest X-rays labeled as either normal, pneumonia, or COVID-19. Although performance would likely be optimal using a pretrained model, the model to be trained here will have an architecture built from custom components created through subclassing PyTorch's nn.Module. Note that the data preprocessing script can be tailored to future use cases involving Kaggle datasets.

#### Requirements
- [ ] *determine complete set of dependencies*
#### Usage
- [ ] *create useage guide for reproducing and modifying project* 
## Project procedures and results
### Motivation and Background
  The COVID-19 pandemic has presented seemingly all areas of society with a host of new and unprecedented challenges, many of which are faced in the healthcare field. While many people living in developed countries are fortunate enough to have relatively easy access to testing, those living in developing or impoverished countries may not be afforded this same luxury. 
  The virus, however, does not discriminate, and therefore additional tools are needed to aid in diagnosing infected patients when the number of tests available are limited (or perhaps even nonexistent). 

- Motivation
  - [x] Explain the problem 
  - [ ] Propose solution(s)
  - [ ] Describe the value of project deliverables w.r.t. proposed solution 
- Background
  - [ ] Summarize how chest X-rays are read
  - [ ] Relate this to the expected end results
### Data wrangling
- [ ] Summarize data sources, and processing
### Model Architecture
- [ ] Get simple visual representation of model architecture
### Training 
- [ ] Describe the structure of the training code
- [ ] Show plots of training history
### Testing
- [ ] Discuss model performance on holdout test data
### Insight and Interpretability
- [ ] Show and discuss results of input attribution obtained using Captum
